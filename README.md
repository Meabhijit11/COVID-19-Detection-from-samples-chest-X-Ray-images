# Background: 
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a public health emergency globally. 
The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. 
Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system.

* During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. 
* Meanwhile, hundreds of machine-learning experts volunteer their time and expertise to help medical researchers in this fight.

* One of the areas where machine learning can help is detecting the COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. 
* The task is a simple classification problem where given an input chest X-ray image, the machine learning-based model must detect whether the subject of study has been infected or not.

# Methods: 
* Here we have implemented Neural Network using CNN to detect pattern from X-Rays Images & give us a Result weather the Person is being Covid Positive or Negative.
